---

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04+ or Debian 12+ server
- Docker Engine 24+ with Docker Compose v2
- Domain pointing to the server's IP
- TLS certificate (via certbot, provisioned separately)

### Required environment files

Each service has a `.env.example`. Copy and fill:

```bash
cp gateway/.env.example gateway/.env
cp payment-service/.env.example payment-service/.env
cp key-service/.env.example key-service/.env
cp key-custody/.env.example key-custody/.env
cp web/.env.example web/.env
```

Key variables:

| Variable | Service | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | gateway | JWT signing key and cookie secret (min 32 chars) |
| `PLATFORM_SERVICE_PRIVKEY` | gateway, payment, key-service | 64-hex Nostr private key for platform service events |
| `READER_HASH_KEY` | gateway | HMAC key for reader pubkey privacy hashing |
| `INTERNAL_SECRET` | gateway, key-custody, key-service | Shared secret authenticating gateway→key-custody and gateway→key-service calls |
| `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` | gateway, payment-service | Shared secret authenticating gateway→payment-service and cron→payment-service calls (all internal endpoints: `/gate-pass`, `/card-connected`, `/payout-cycle`, `/settlement-check/monthly`) |
| `ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX` | key-custody **only** | AES-256 key for encrypting custodial Nostr privkeys at rest |
| `KMS_MASTER_KEY_HEX` | key-service | AES-256 master key for vault content key envelope encryption |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | gateway, payment | Stripe API key (validated at startup — gateway will not boot without it) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | web | Stripe publishable key (build fails if missing — no placeholder fallback) |
| `KEY_SERVICE_URL` | gateway | Internal URL for key-service (**required** — no localhost fallback) |
| `KEY_CUSTODY_URL` | gateway | Internal URL for key-custody (default: http://localhost:3004) |
| `PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL` | gateway | Internal URL for payment-service (**required** — no localhost fallback) |
| `PLATFORM_RELAY_WS_URL` | gateway, payment, key-service | strfry WebSocket URL (default: ws://localhost:4848) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | gateway | Google OAuth credentials |
| `APP_URL` | gateway | **Frontend** URL (Next.js). Used for OAuth redirect URIs, Stripe redirects, CORS, and magic links. Dev: `http://localhost:3010`. **Must not be the gateway URL.** |
| `ADMIN_ACCOUNT_IDS` | gateway | Comma-separated UUIDs for admin access (fallback; prefer `admin_account_ids` in `platform_config` table — no redeploy needed) |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | gateway | `postmark`, `resend`, or `console` |

> **Security:** `ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX` must never be set on the gateway — the key-custody service is the sole holder of this key by design. The gateway cannot decrypt user private keys.

> **Startup validation (v4.2.0, strengthened in v5.7.0):** All services validate required environment variables at startup and refuse to boot if any are missing. `SESSION_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters. `ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX` and `KMS_MASTER_KEY_HEX` must be at least 32 characters. `APP_URL` is now required (no localhost fallback in production). As of v5.7.0, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `READER_HASH_KEY`, `KEY_SERVICE_URL`, and `PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL` are also validated at gateway startup (previously these had silent fallbacks or warnings). If a service exits immediately on boot, check its logs for `Missing required environment variable:` messages.

---

## Fresh deployment

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ejklake/platform-pub /root/platform-pub
cd /root/platform-pub
```

> **Local dev only:** each service imports `shared/` via a sibling symlink. These are committed to the repo, so `git clone` restores them automatically. If for any reason they are missing:
> ```bash
> ln -snf ../shared gateway/shared
> ln -snf ../shared payment-service/shared
> ln -snf ../shared key-service/shared
> ln -snf ../shared key-custody/shared
> ```

### 2. Create environment files

```bash
# Generate a strong Postgres password
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 24)
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" > .env

cp gateway/.env.example gateway/.env
cp payment-service/.env.example payment-service/.env
cp key-service/.env.example key-service/.env
cp key-custody/.env.example key-custody/.env
cp web/.env.example web/.env
# Edit each file with your actual keys
```

Generate cryptographic secrets:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32   # SESSION_SECRET, READER_HASH_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32   # ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX (key-custody only)
openssl rand -hex 32   # KMS_MASTER_KEY_HEX (key-service only)
openssl rand -base64 32  # INTERNAL_SECRET (gateway + key-custody + key-service)
openssl rand -base64 32  # INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN (gateway + payment-service)
# For PLATFORM_SERVICE_PRIVKEY: generate a Nostr keypair — any hex ed25519 privkey
```

### 3. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres strfry
docker compose ps   # wait for postgres to be healthy
```

### 4. Apply schema and migrations

The base schema (`schema.sql`) is auto-applied on first postgres boot via the `initdb.d` volume mount. As of v5.13.0, `schema.sql` includes all structural changes through migration 038; the `_migrations` table is pre-seeded accordingly.

For **fresh** databases: no action needed — the schema and `_migrations` seed handle everything.

For **existing** databases that were initialised with an earlier `schema.sql`, use the migration runner:

```bash
# From the host (with DATABASE_URL set):
DATABASE_URL=postgres://platformpub:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/platformpub \
  npx tsx shared/src/db/migrate.ts

# Or via Docker:
docker compose exec gateway npx tsx /app/shared/src/db/migrate.ts
```

The runner reads `migrations/` in order, checks the `_migrations` table, and applies only pending files inside transactions.

Alternatively, apply migrations manually:

```bash
for f in migrations/*.sql; do
  echo "Applying $f..."
  docker exec -i platform-pub-postgres-1 psql -U platformpub platformpub < "$f"
done
```

Verify:
```bash
docker exec platform-pub-postgres-1 psql -U platformpub platformpub -c "\dt"
```

You should see 45+ tables.

### 5. Build and start all services

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

### 6. Provision TLS

```bash
docker compose run --rm certbot certonly \
  --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot \
  -d yourdomain.com --agree-tos -m you@example.com

docker compose restart nginx
```

### 7. Server hardening (production)

```bash
bash scripts/harden-server.sh
```

Configures UFW (ports 22, 80, 443 only), SSH key-only auth, and certbot auto-renewal.

### 8. Seed data (staging / development only)

The seed script (`scripts/seed.ts`) populates the database with realistic fake users, articles, follows, subscriptions, DMs, votes, pledge drives, and reading activity. **Do not run on production.**

```bash
# Default: 200 writers, 800 readers (~1000 users), dense relationships
ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX=<your key-custody ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX> \
DATABASE_URL=postgres://platformpub:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/platformpub \
  npx tsx scripts/seed.ts --clean

# Small dataset: 15 writers, 25 readers (fast, for quick testing)
ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX=<...> npx tsx scripts/seed.ts --clean --small

# Custom sizes:
ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX=<...> npx tsx scripts/seed.ts --clean --writers 50 --readers 200 --articles 10
```

> **Required env vars:** `ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX` (from key-custody `.env`) is required to generate encrypted Nostr keypairs for seeded accounts. `KMS_MASTER_KEY_HEX` (from key-service `.env`) is required for vault key generation on paywalled articles. Without these, the seed script will create accounts without custodial keypairs and skip vault key generation respectively.

Options:
- `--clean` — wipe all seeded data before re-seeding (preserves the `billyisland` account)
- `--writers N` — number of writer accounts (default 200, or 15 with `--small`)
- `--readers N` — number of reader-only accounts (default 800, or 25 with `--small`)
- `--articles N` — max articles per writer (default 8, or 6 with `--small`)
- `--small` — use small defaults (equivalent to `--writers 15 --readers 25 --articles 6`)

The script generates: accounts, articles, notes, follows, subscriptions (monthly/annual/cancelled/comp), comments, reading tabs + read events, feed engagement, votes + tallies, DM conversations + messages, notifications, pledge drives + pledges, blocks, and mutes.

## Upgrading from a previous version

> **Important — how builds work:** The web (and all other) services run entirely inside Docker containers. Running `npm run build` or `npm run dev` locally on the host has **no effect on the live site** — those outputs go to a local `.next/` folder that the container never reads. All deployments must go through `docker compose build <service>` followed by `docker compose up -d <service>`.

### From v5.22.0

No migration. Services changed: **web**. Deploy order: **rebuild web**.

This release fixes a build-breaking type error in the `FeaturedWriters` homepage component. The v5.22.0 audit removed the unused `feed.featured()` API client method, but `FeaturedWriters.tsx` still called it, preventing the Next.js production build from compiling.

**Frontend (web):**

- **FeaturedWriters fix** (`FeaturedWriters.tsx`): Replaced `feedApi.featured()` (removed in v5.22.0) with `feedApi.get('explore', undefined, 3)`. Response field updated from `data.articles` to `data.items` to match the feed endpoint's actual response shape.

**Modified files:**

- `web/src/components/home/FeaturedWriters.tsx` — API call and response field fixed

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
cd /root/platform-pub
git pull origin master

# No migration — frontend fix only
docker compose build web
docker compose up -d web
```

Verify:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
# web should show (healthy) after ~30s

# Visual checks:
# - / (homepage, logged out): featured writers section loads with 3 articles
```

No new env vars. No database changes.

### From v5.21.0

No migration. Services changed: **gateway**, **web**. Deploy order: **rebuild gateway + web**.

This release fixes critical bugs found during audit: gate-pass access for publication members/subscribers, schema ON DELETE clause sync, publication article deletion on the relay, and dead code removal. Editor title/subtitle sizing is also refined.

**Backend (gateway):**

- **Gate-pass publication access fix (critical):** `publication_id` now passed to `checkArticleAccess()` — publication members and subscribers were previously charged for their own publication's paywalled articles.
- **Publication article kind 5 deletion:** `DELETE /publications/:id/articles/:articleId` now publishes a Nostr kind 5 deletion event to the relay.
- **Publication PATCH updated_at:** `PATCH /publications/:id` now sets `updated_at = now()`.
- **Dead code removal:** Deleted dead comment system (route, 3 components, lib file). Removed legacy `/feed/global` and `/feed/following` endpoints. Removed unused `feed.global()`, `feed.following()`, `feed.featured()` API client wrappers.

**Schema:**

- **schema.sql ON DELETE clauses:** Synced with migration 021 — added missing cascade/restrict/set-null clauses on FK constraints.

**Frontend (web):**

- **Editor sizing:** Title and subtitle card padding and font sizes reduced to match surrounding controls.

**Modified files:**

- `gateway/src/routes/articles.ts` — gate-pass publication_id lookup
- `gateway/src/services/access.ts` — receives publication_id parameter
- `gateway/src/routes/publications.ts` — kind 5 deletion, updated_at on PATCH
- `gateway/src/routes/notes.ts` — dead feed endpoints removed
- `schema.sql` — ON DELETE clauses synced
- `web/src/lib/api.ts` — dead feed methods removed
- `web/src/components/editor/ArticleEditor.tsx` — title/subtitle sizing

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
cd /root/platform-pub
git pull origin master

# No migration — but schema.sql updated for fresh installs
docker compose build gateway web
docker compose up -d gateway web
```

Verify:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
# gateway and web should show (healthy) after ~30s

# Critical check — publication members can read paywalled articles without being charged:
# - Log in as a publication member, read a paywalled publication article
# - /account: no new debit entry for that read
```

No new env vars. No database changes.

### From v5.20.0

No new migration. Services changed: **gateway**, **web**. Deploy order: **rebuild gateway + web**.

This release fixes a Fastify duplicate-route crash that prevented the gateway from starting. The public published-articles endpoint (`GET /publications/:slug/articles`) collided with the CMS article-list endpoint (`GET /publications/:id/articles`) because Fastify treats path parameters at the same position as identical regardless of name. The public route is now at `/publications/by-slug/:slug/articles`.

**Backend (gateway):**

- **Route path change** (`publications.ts`): `GET /publications/:slug/articles` → `GET /publications/by-slug/:slug/articles`. Resolves `FST_ERR_DUPLICATED_ROUTE` crash on startup.

**Frontend (web):**

- **API client** (`api.ts`): `getPublicArticles()` updated to call `/publications/by-slug/${slug}/articles`.
- **Publication homepage** (`pub/[slug]/page.tsx`): SSR fetch updated to new route path.
- **Publication archive** (`pub/[slug]/archive/page.tsx`): SSR fetch updated to new route path.

**Modified files:**

- `gateway/src/routes/publications.ts` — public articles route path changed
- `web/src/lib/api.ts` — `getPublicArticles` path updated
- `web/src/app/pub/[slug]/page.tsx` — SSR fetch path updated
- `web/src/app/pub/[slug]/archive/page.tsx` — SSR fetch path updated

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
cd /root/platform-pub
git pull origin master

# No migration — route path fix only
docker compose build gateway web
docker compose up -d gateway web
```

Verify:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
# gateway and web should show (healthy) after ~30s

# Critical check — gateway must not be crash-looping:
docker compose logs gateway --tail=5
# Should show "Server listening" — not FST_ERR_DUPLICATED_ROUTE

# Visual checks:
# - /pub/<slug>: publication homepage loads with articles
# - /pub/<slug>/archive: archive page loads with full article list
```

No new env vars. No database changes.

### From v5.19.0

No new migration. Services changed: **gateway**, **payment-service**, **web**. Deploy order: **rebuild gateway + payment + web**.

This release implements Publications Phase 5 — revenue management. Publication owners and finance managers can now configure subscription and per-article pricing (rate card), set standing revenue shares and per-article overrides for contributors (payroll), and view earnings dashboards. The daily payout worker now runs a publication payout cycle after the individual writer cycle, distributing revenue to members via Stripe Connect transfers based on their standing shares and article-specific overrides.

**Backend (gateway):**

- **Rate card routes** (`publications.ts`): `GET/PATCH /publications/:id/rate-card` — view and update `subscription_price_pence`, `annual_discount_pct`, `default_article_price_pence`. Requires `can_manage_finances` permission.
- **Payroll routes** (`publications.ts`): `GET /publications/:id/payroll` — view standing member shares (with user details) and per-article overrides. `PATCH /publications/:id/payroll` — bulk-update standing shares with 10,000 bps (100%) cap validation. `PATCH /publications/:id/payroll/article/:articleId` — upsert per-article share (revenue % or flat fee).
- **Earnings routes** (`publications.ts`): `GET /publications/:id/earnings` — summary totals (gross/net/pending/paid/readCount), per-article revenue breakdown, payout history with splits. Uses config-loaded `platform_fee_bps`.

**Backend (payment-service):**

- **Publication payout worker** (`payout.ts`): New `runPublicationPayoutCycle()` method on `PayoutService`. Finds publications with settled revenue above the payout threshold, then for each: (1) deducts platform fee, (2) pays flat-fee per-article overrides first, (3) distributes article revenue-share overrides, (4) distributes remaining pool by standing member shares, (5) initiates Stripe Connect transfers to each member's personal account, (6) records `publication_payouts` and `publication_payout_splits` rows, (7) marks `read_events` as `writer_paid`. Members without Stripe KYC get splits recorded as `pending`.
- **Payout worker** (`workers/payout.ts`): Now calls `runPublicationPayoutCycle()` after the individual writer payout cycle.

**Frontend (web):**

- **RateCardTab** (`RateCardTab.tsx`): Subscription pricing form (monthly price, annual discount %, default per-article price) with live annual price preview.
- **PayrollTab** (`PayrollTab.tsx`): Standing share editor with visual distribution bar, per-member bps input, 100% cap validation. Per-article overrides table showing article title, contributor, share type, value, and paid status.
- **PublicationEarningsTab** (`PublicationEarningsTab.tsx`): Summary cards (net earnings, pending, paid, read count), per-article revenue table, payout history with per-member split details.
- **Dashboard** (`dashboard/page.tsx`): Publication context now shows Rate card, Payroll, and Earnings tabs for members with `can_manage_finances` permission.
- **API client** (`api.ts`): `getRateCard`, `updateRateCard`, `getPayroll`, `updatePayroll`, `setArticleShare`, `getEarnings` methods on the publications namespace.

**New files:**

- `web/src/components/dashboard/RateCardTab.tsx`
- `web/src/components/dashboard/PayrollTab.tsx`
- `web/src/components/dashboard/PublicationEarningsTab.tsx`

**Modified files:**

- `gateway/src/routes/publications.ts` — rate card, payroll, and earnings routes added
- `payment-service/src/services/payout.ts` — `runPublicationPayoutCycle()` and `initiatePublicationPayout()` methods added
- `payment-service/src/workers/payout.ts` — calls publication payout cycle after writer cycle
- `web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — new publication tabs (rate-card, payroll, earnings) with `can_manage_finances` gating
- `web/src/lib/api.ts` — revenue API client methods

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
cd /root/platform-pub
git pull origin master

# No new migration — publication schema (038) already in place
# Rebuild gateway (new routes), payment (payout worker), and web (new tabs)
docker compose build gateway payment web
docker compose up -d gateway payment web
```

Verify:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
# gateway, payment, and web should show (healthy) after ~30s

# Visual checks:
# - /dashboard?context=<slug>: "Rate card", "Payroll", "Earnings" tabs visible for finance managers
# - Rate card tab: subscription price, annual discount, default article price fields
# - Payroll tab: standing shares with visual bar, per-article overrides table
# - Earnings tab: summary cards, per-article revenue table, payout history
```

No new env vars. No database changes.

### From v5.18.0

No new migration (038 was applied in v5.18.0). Services changed: **gateway**, **key-custody**, **web**. Deploy order: **rebuild gateway + key-custody + web**.

This release implements Publications Phases 2 and 3 — the CMS/publishing pipeline and the full reader-facing surface. Writers can now submit articles to publications, editors can approve and publish them (signed with the publication's Nostr keypair), and publications have their own homepage, about page, masthead, archive, RSS feed, subscription, and follow system. The feed and search engines now include publication content. Article pages show "By Author in Publication" bylines when applicable. Writer profiles filter out publication-only articles.

**Backend (key-custody):**

No changes beyond Phase 1 (signerType support already in place).

**Backend (gateway):**

- **Publication CMS routes** (`publications.ts`): `POST/GET /publications/:id/articles` (submit + list), `PATCH/DELETE /publications/:id/articles/:articleId` (edit/delete), `POST .../publish` and `.../unpublish` (approve/reject).
- **Server-side publishing pipeline** (`publication-publisher.ts`): New service that orchestrates article submission — generates d-tags, builds NIP-23 events with author/publisher p-tags, signs with publication key via key-custody, publishes to relay, indexes in DB. Contributors without `can_publish` save as 'submitted'; editors approve and trigger full pipeline.
- **Signing routes** (`signing.ts`): `/sign` and `/sign-and-publish` accept optional `publicationId` — checks `can_publish` permission, signs with publication key.
- **Draft routes** (`drafts.ts`): drafts can be associated with a publication via `publicationId`.
- **Public reader routes** (`publications.ts`): `GET /:slug/public` (full profile with follower/member/article counts, isFollowing, isSubscribed), `GET /by-slug/:slug/articles` (paginated), `GET /:slug/masthead`.
- **Publication subscriptions** (`subscriptions.ts`): `POST/DELETE /subscriptions/publication/:id`.
- **Publication follows** (`follows.ts`): `POST/DELETE /follows/publication/:id`. `GET /follows/pubkeys` includes followed publication pubkeys.
- **Publication RSS** (`rss.ts`): `GET /api/v1/pub/:slug/rss`.
- **Search** (`search.ts`): Publications searchable by name/tagline via pg_trgm.
- **Feed** (`feed.ts`): Following feed includes articles from followed publications.
- **Feed scorer** (`feed-scorer.ts`): Populates `publication_id` on feed_scores.
- **Article page** (`articles.ts`): `GET /articles/:dTag` now returns `publication` object (id, slug, name, subscriptionPricePence) when article belongs to a publication.
- **Writer profile** (`writers.ts`): Article queries filter `(publication_id IS NULL OR show_on_writer_profile = TRUE)`.

**Frontend (web):**

- **Editor** (`ArticleEditor.tsx`): "Publishing as" dropdown, "Also show on your personal profile" checkbox, "Submit for review" button for non-publishers.
- **Write page** (`write/page.tsx`): `?pub=<slug>` pre-selection, routes to `publishToPublication()` for publication articles.
- **Dashboard** (`dashboard/page.tsx`): Context switcher (Personal | Publication), publication-specific tabs (Articles, Members, Settings).
- **Publication dashboard tabs**: `PublicationArticlesTab.tsx` (CMS with publish/unpublish), `MembersTab.tsx` (invite, manage), `PublicationSettingsTab.tsx` (edit metadata).
- **Invite page** (`invite/[token]/page.tsx`): Shows invite details, accept/decline for logged-in users, signup redirect for anonymous.
- **Publication reader pages**: layout shell (`pub/[slug]/layout.tsx`), homepage with blog/magazine/minimal layouts (`page.tsx`), about, masthead, subscribe, archive, article-under-publication pages.
- **Publication components**: `PublicationNav.tsx`, `PublicationFooter.tsx`, `HomepageBlog.tsx`, `HomepageMagazine.tsx`, `HomepageMinimal.tsx`.
- **Article reader** (`ArticleReader.tsx`): "By Author in Publication" byline, publication subscription price used when applicable.
- **API client** (`api.ts`): Full publications namespace with reader-facing methods (getPublic, getPublicArticles, getMasthead, follow, unfollow, subscribe, cancelSubscription).

- `web/src/components/article/ArticleReader.tsx` — publication byline
- `web/src/app/article/[dTag]/page.tsx` — passes publication props

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
cd /root/platform-pub
git pull origin master

# No new migration — 038 was applied in v5.18.0
# Rebuild all three services (gateway has new routes + services, web has new pages)
docker compose build gateway key-custody web
docker compose up -d gateway key-custody web
```

Verify:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
# gateway, key-custody, and web should show (healthy) after ~30s

# Visual checks:
# - /write page: "Publishing as" dropdown appears if user is a publication member
# - /dashboard: context switcher shows personal + publication names
# - /dashboard?context=<slug>: publication Articles/Members/Settings tabs
# - /pub/<slug>: publication homepage with nav, articles, footer
# - /pub/<slug>/about: about page with rendered markdown
# - /pub/<slug>/masthead: team listing with avatars and roles
# - /pub/<slug>/archive: full article list with dates
# - /article/<dTag>: articles with publication show "By Author in Publication" byline
# - /<username>: writer profile excludes publication-only articles
# - /search: publications appear in search results
```

No new env vars. No database changes.

> **Older versions:** Upgrade instructions for v5.18.0 and earlier are available in this file's git history.

## Nostr event types

| Kind | Type | Publisher | Purpose |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| 0 | Metadata | User (via key-custody) | Profile (name, bio, avatar) |
| 1 | Note | User (via key-custody) | Short-form post |
| 3 | Contacts | User (via key-custody) | Follow list |
| 5 | Deletion | User (via key-custody) | Soft-delete article or note. Published by the gateway on article delete and note delete — used by feed clients to filter deleted events from relay query results |
| 7003 | Subscription | Platform service key | Subscription status (provisional NIP-88) |
| 30023 | Long-form article | User or Publication (via key-custody) | NIP-23 article with optional `['payload', ciphertext, algorithm]` tag for paywalled content. Publication articles are signed with the publication's keypair (signerType='publication') and include author/publisher p-tags |
| 30024 | Draft | User (via key-custody) | NIP-23 draft |
| 9901 | Receipt | Platform service key | Gate-pass receipt (public relay: HMAC reader hash; private DB copy: actual reader pubkey) |

### Paywall content format

Paywalled articles embed encrypted content directly in the kind 30023 event:

```
tag: ['payload', <base64 ciphertext>, 'xchacha20poly1305']
```

Format: `base64(nonce[24] || ciphertext_with_tag)` — XChaCha20-Poly1305 via @noble/ciphers.

The content key is issued via `POST /api/v1/articles/:eventId/key` (after gate-pass), wrapped with NIP-44 (ChaCha20-Poly1305) to the reader's Nostr pubkey.

Legacy articles (pre-v3.0) used a separate kind 39701 vault event with AES-256-GCM. Both formats remain decryptable — the `algorithm` field in the key-service response drives the decryption path.

---

## Key custody

The `key-custody` service (port 3004) is the sole holder of all user and publication Nostr private keys. It holds `ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX` — the AES-256 key used to encrypt private keys at rest in `accounts.nostr_privkey_enc` and `publications.nostr_privkey_enc`. **No other service has access to this key.**

The gateway calls key-custody for these operations:
- `POST /keypairs/generate` — generate and store a new Nostr keypair for a new user
- `POST /keypairs/sign` — sign a Nostr event with a user's or publication's private key
- `POST /keypairs/unwrap-nip44` — NIP-44 decrypt (for reading encrypted DMs, key deliveries)
- `POST /keypairs/nip44-encrypt` — NIP-44 encrypt
- `POST /keypairs/nip44-decrypt` — NIP-44 decrypt

All signing and encryption endpoints accept `signerId` + `signerType` (`'account'` | `'publication'`). When `signerType` is `'publication'`, the private key is looked up from the `publications` table. Backwards-compatible: `accountId` still accepted.

All calls carry `x-internal-secret` (shared secret between gateway and key-custody). The key-custody service rejects any request missing this header.

---

## Author migration export

Writers can export a complete migration bundle via `GET /api/v1/account/export`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "exportedAt": "...",
  "account": { "nostrPubkey": "...", "username": "...", "displayName": "..." },
  "articles": [
    {
      "articleId": "...",
      "nostrEventId": "...",
      "dTag": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "isPaywalled": true,
      "algorithm": "xchacha20poly1305",
      "encryptedKey": "<NIP-44 wrapped to writer's own pubkey>",
      "readerPubkeys": ["<hex>", ...]
    }
  ],
  "summary": { "totalArticles": 5, "paywallArticles": 3, "contentKeysExported": 3, "uniqueReaders": 12 }
}
```

- `encryptedKey` — decrypt with the writer's own Nostr private key (NIP-44, sender = platform service key) to get the 32-byte content key, then use `algorithm` to decrypt the article body.
- `readerPubkeys` — readers who have paid for that article. A receiving host can honour these without re-charging.
- Nostr events (profile, follow list, articles) are on the relay and fetchable by the writer's pubkey — they are not duplicated in the export.

---

## Receipt portability

Readers export their paid-access receipts via `GET /api/v1/receipts/export`. Each receipt is a signed Nostr kind 9901 event (signed by the platform service key) containing:

```
['e', articleEventId]     — article read
['p', writerPubkey]       — writer
['reader', readerPubkey]  — reader (actual pubkey)
['amount', pence, 'GBP']  — amount charged
['gate', 'passed']
```

A receiving host verifies receipts by:
1. Fetching this host's signing pubkey: `GET /api/v1/platform-pubkey`
2. Calling `verifyEvent(receipt)` from nostr-tools
3. Checking `receipt.pubkey` matches the platform pubkey

---

## Subscription system

1. Writers set a monthly price (£1–£100, default £5)
2. Subscribers are charged immediately via Stripe; access is immediate
3. Active subscription unlocks all that writer's paywalled content at zero per-article cost
4. Each subscription creates a kind 7003 Nostr event (signed by platform service key) for federation
5. Unlocks are permanent — survive cancellation
6. Cancellation grants access until period end

### Access check priority

1. Own content → free
2. Publication member (if article belongs to a publication) → free
3. Permanent unlock (`article_unlocks`) → free, key reissued
4. Active subscription (writer or publication) → free, creates permanent unlock + subscription_read log
5. Payment flow → charges reading tab, creates permanent unlock

---

## Media uploads

Images uploaded via `POST /api/v1/media/upload` are resized (max 1200px), converted to WebP (quality 80), and written to the `media_data` volume at `/app/media/<sha256>.webp`. Nginx serves them at `/media/<sha256>.webp` with 1-year cache headers.

- Email sending requires configuring `EMAIL_PROVIDER` — defaults to console logging
- Docker healthchecks on some Alpine containers report "unhealthy" due to missing `wget`/`curl` in the image, despite services running correctly

## Change log

### v5.23.0 — 7 April 2026

**Fix: FeaturedWriters build error — removed API method still referenced**

No migration. Services changed: web.

- **FeaturedWriters build fix:** `FeaturedWriters.tsx` called `feedApi.featured()` which was removed in v5.22.0's dead code cleanup, breaking the Next.js production build. Replaced with `feedApi.get('explore', undefined, 3)` and updated response field from `data.articles` to `data.items`.

### v5.22.0 — 7 April 2026

**Audit fixes: critical bugs, dead code removal, editor polish**

No new migration. Services changed: gateway, web. Schema updated: `schema.sql`.

- **Gate-pass publication access fix (critical):** The gate-pass handler now SELECTs `publication_id` from the article and passes it to `checkArticleAccess()`. Previously publication members and subscribers were incorrectly charged for reading their own publication's paywalled articles.
- **schema.sql ON DELETE clauses:** Synced `schema.sql` with migration 021 — added missing `ON DELETE CASCADE`, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, and `ON DELETE SET NULL` clauses to FK constraints on `subscriptions`, `subscription_events`, `article_unlocks`, `vote_charges`, `pledges`, `conversations`, and `publication_payouts`. Fresh database instances from `schema.sql` now match migrated databases.
- **Publication article kind 5 deletion:** `DELETE /publications/:id/articles/:articleId` now publishes a Nostr kind 5 deletion event to the relay (matching the personal article delete behaviour). Previously deleted publication articles lingered on the relay.
- **Publication PATCH updated_at:** `PATCH /publications/:id` now sets `updated_at = now()`.
- **Dead code removal:** Deleted dead comment system (gateway route, 3 frontend components, lib file — never registered or imported). Removed legacy `/feed/global` and `/feed/following` endpoints from `notes.ts` (broken column name, no block/mute filtering, duplicated by `feed.ts`). Removed unused `feed.global()`, `feed.following()`, `feed.featured()` API client wrappers.
- **Editor title/subtitle sizing:** Reduced title card padding from `p-8 sm:p-10` to `px-5 py-4` and title font from `text-4xl sm:text-5xl` to `text-2xl sm:text-3xl`. Subtitle card padding similarly reduced. Fields now match the proportions of surrounding controls.

### v5.21.0 — 7 April 2026

**Fix: gateway crash — duplicate route collision on publication articles**

No migration. Services changed: gateway, web.

- **Route collision fix:** `GET /publications/:slug/articles` (public) and `GET /publications/:id/articles` (CMS) registered identical Fastify route patterns, causing `FST_ERR_DUPLICATED_ROUTE` and a gateway crash loop. Public route moved to `GET /publications/by-slug/:slug/articles`. Frontend callers (`api.ts`, `pub/[slug]/page.tsx`, `pub/[slug]/archive/page.tsx`) updated.

### v5.20.0 — 6 April 2026

**Publications Phase 5: Revenue — rate card, payroll, payout worker, earnings dashboard**

No new migration. Services changed: gateway, payment-service, web.

- **Rate card routes:** `GET/PATCH /publications/:id/rate-card` for subscription pricing, annual discount, and default per-article pricing. Gated on `can_manage_finances`.
- **Payroll routes:** `GET/PATCH /publications/:id/payroll` for standing revenue shares (10,000 bps cap); `PATCH /publications/:id/payroll/article/:articleId` for per-article overrides (revenue % or flat fee, upsert semantics).
- **Publication payout worker:** `runPublicationPayoutCycle()` runs after individual writer payouts. Processes flat fees first, then article revenue shares, then standing shares. Stripe Connect transfers to members; pending status for unverified accounts. Records `publication_payouts` + `publication_payout_splits`.
- **Earnings dashboard:** `GET /publications/:id/earnings` returns summary totals, per-article breakdown, and payout history with splits. Platform fee loaded from config.
- **Dashboard tabs:** Rate card (pricing form), Payroll (share editor with visual bar + overrides table), Earnings (summary cards, revenue table, payout history). All gated on `can_manage_finances`.
- **API client:** `getRateCard`, `updateRateCard`, `getPayroll`, `updatePayroll`, `setArticleShare`, `getEarnings`.
