---

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04+ or Debian 12+ server
- Docker Engine 24+ with Docker Compose v2
- Domain pointing to the server's IP
- TLS certificate (via certbot, provisioned separately)

### Required environment files

Each service has a `.env.example`. Copy and fill:

```bash
cp gateway/.env.example gateway/.env
cp payment-service/.env.example payment-service/.env
cp key-service/.env.example key-service/.env
cp key-custody/.env.example key-custody/.env
cp web/.env.example web/.env
```

Key variables:

| Variable | Service | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | gateway | JWT signing key and cookie secret (min 32 chars) |
| `PLATFORM_SERVICE_PRIVKEY` | gateway, payment, key-service | 64-hex Nostr private key for platform service events |
| `READER_HASH_KEY` | gateway | HMAC key for reader pubkey privacy hashing |
| `INTERNAL_SECRET` | gateway, key-custody, key-service | Shared secret authenticating gateway→key-custody and gateway→key-service calls |
| `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` | gateway, payment-service | Shared secret authenticating gateway→payment-service and cron→payment-service calls (all internal endpoints: `/gate-pass`, `/card-connected`, `/payout-cycle`, `/settlement-check/monthly`) |
| `ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX` | key-custody **only** | AES-256 key for encrypting custodial Nostr privkeys at rest |
| `KMS_MASTER_KEY_HEX` | key-service | AES-256 master key for vault content key envelope encryption |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | gateway, payment | Stripe API key (validated at startup — gateway will not boot without it) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | web | Stripe publishable key (build fails if missing — no placeholder fallback) |
| `KEY_SERVICE_URL` | gateway | Internal URL for key-service (**required** — no localhost fallback) |
| `KEY_CUSTODY_URL` | gateway | Internal URL for key-custody (default: http://localhost:3004) |
| `PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL` | gateway | Internal URL for payment-service (**required** — no localhost fallback) |
| `PLATFORM_RELAY_WS_URL` | gateway, payment, key-service | strfry WebSocket URL (default: ws://localhost:4848) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | gateway | Google OAuth credentials |
| `APP_URL` | gateway | **Frontend** URL (Next.js). Used for OAuth redirect URIs, Stripe redirects, CORS, and magic links. Dev: `http://localhost:3010`. **Must not be the gateway URL.** |
| `ADMIN_ACCOUNT_IDS` | gateway | Comma-separated UUIDs for admin access (fallback; prefer `admin_account_ids` in `platform_config` table — no redeploy needed) |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | gateway | `postmark`, `resend`, or `console` |

> **Security:** `ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX` must never be set on the gateway — the key-custody service is the sole holder of this key by design. The gateway cannot decrypt user private keys.

> **Startup validation (v4.2.0, strengthened in v5.7.0):** All services validate required environment variables at startup and refuse to boot if any are missing. `SESSION_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters. `ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX` and `KMS_MASTER_KEY_HEX` must be at least 32 characters. `APP_URL` is now required (no localhost fallback in production). As of v5.7.0, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `READER_HASH_KEY`, `KEY_SERVICE_URL`, and `PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL` are also validated at gateway startup (previously these had silent fallbacks or warnings). If a service exits immediately on boot, check its logs for `Missing required environment variable:` messages.

---

## Fresh deployment

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ejklake/platform-pub /root/platform-pub
cd /root/platform-pub
```

> **Local dev only:** each service imports `shared/` via a sibling symlink. These are committed to the repo, so `git clone` restores them automatically. If for any reason they are missing:
> ```bash
> ln -snf ../shared gateway/shared
> ln -snf ../shared payment-service/shared
> ln -snf ../shared key-service/shared
> ln -snf ../shared key-custody/shared
> ```

### 2. Create environment files

```bash
# Generate a strong Postgres password
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 24)
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" > .env

cp gateway/.env.example gateway/.env
cp payment-service/.env.example payment-service/.env
cp key-service/.env.example key-service/.env
cp key-custody/.env.example key-custody/.env
cp web/.env.example web/.env
# Edit each file with your actual keys
```

Generate cryptographic secrets:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32   # SESSION_SECRET, READER_HASH_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32   # ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX (key-custody only)
openssl rand -hex 32   # KMS_MASTER_KEY_HEX (key-service only)
openssl rand -base64 32  # INTERNAL_SECRET (gateway + key-custody + key-service)
openssl rand -base64 32  # INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN (gateway + payment-service)
# For PLATFORM_SERVICE_PRIVKEY: generate a Nostr keypair — any hex ed25519 privkey
```

### 3. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres strfry
docker compose ps   # wait for postgres to be healthy
```

### 4. Apply schema and migrations

The base schema (`schema.sql`) is auto-applied on first postgres boot via the `initdb.d` volume mount. As of v5.13.0, `schema.sql` includes all structural changes through migration 038; the `_migrations` table is pre-seeded accordingly.

For **fresh** databases: no action needed — the schema and `_migrations` seed handle everything.

For **existing** databases that were initialised with an earlier `schema.sql`, use the migration runner:

```bash
# From the host (with DATABASE_URL set):
DATABASE_URL=postgres://platformpub:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/platformpub \
  npx tsx shared/src/db/migrate.ts

# Or via Docker:
docker compose exec gateway npx tsx /app/shared/src/db/migrate.ts
```

The runner reads `migrations/` in order, checks the `_migrations` table, and applies only pending files inside transactions.

Alternatively, apply migrations manually:

```bash
for f in migrations/*.sql; do
  echo "Applying $f..."
  docker exec -i platform-pub-postgres-1 psql -U platformpub platformpub < "$f"
done
```

Verify:
```bash
docker exec platform-pub-postgres-1 psql -U platformpub platformpub -c "\dt"
```

You should see 45+ tables.

### 5. Build and start all services

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

### 6. Provision TLS

```bash
docker compose run --rm certbot certonly \
  --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot \
  -d yourdomain.com --agree-tos -m you@example.com

docker compose restart nginx
```

### 7. Server hardening (production)

```bash
bash scripts/harden-server.sh
```

Configures UFW (ports 22, 80, 443 only), SSH key-only auth, and certbot auto-renewal.

### 8. Seed data (staging / development only)

The seed script (`scripts/seed.ts`) populates the database with realistic fake users, articles, follows, subscriptions, DMs, votes, pledge drives, and reading activity. **Do not run on production.**

```bash
# Default: 200 writers, 800 readers (~1000 users), dense relationships
ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX=<your key-custody ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX> \
DATABASE_URL=postgres://platformpub:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/platformpub \
  npx tsx scripts/seed.ts --clean

# Small dataset: 15 writers, 25 readers (fast, for quick testing)
ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX=<...> npx tsx scripts/seed.ts --clean --small

# Custom sizes:
ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX=<...> npx tsx scripts/seed.ts --clean --writers 50 --readers 200 --articles 10
```

> **Required env vars:** `ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX` (from key-custody `.env`) is required to generate encrypted Nostr keypairs for seeded accounts. `KMS_MASTER_KEY_HEX` (from key-service `.env`) is required for vault key generation on paywalled articles. Without these, the seed script will create accounts without custodial keypairs and skip vault key generation respectively.

Options:
- `--clean` — wipe all seeded data before re-seeding (preserves the `billyisland` account)
- `--writers N` — number of writer accounts (default 200, or 15 with `--small`)
- `--readers N` — number of reader-only accounts (default 800, or 25 with `--small`)
- `--articles N` — max articles per writer (default 8, or 6 with `--small`)
- `--small` — use small defaults (equivalent to `--writers 15 --readers 25 --articles 6`)

The script generates: accounts, articles, notes, follows, subscriptions (monthly/annual/cancelled/comp), comments, reading tabs + read events, feed engagement, votes + tallies, DM conversations + messages, notifications, pledge drives + pledges, blocks, and mutes.

---

## Upgrading from a previous version

> **Important — how builds work:** The web (and all other) services run entirely inside Docker containers. Running `npm run build` or `npm run dev` locally on the host has **no effect on the live site** — those outputs go to a local `.next/` folder that the container never reads. All deployments must go through `docker compose build <service>` followed by `docker compose up -d <service>`.

### From v5.18.0

No new migration (038 was applied in v5.18.0). Services changed: **gateway**, **key-custody**, **web**. Deploy order: **rebuild gateway + key-custody + web**.

This release implements Publications Phases 2 and 3 — the CMS/publishing pipeline and the full reader-facing surface. Writers can now submit articles to publications, editors can approve and publish them (signed with the publication's Nostr keypair), and publications have their own homepage, about page, masthead, archive, RSS feed, subscription, and follow system. The feed and search engines now include publication content. Article pages show "By Author in Publication" bylines when applicable. Writer profiles filter out publication-only articles.

**Backend (key-custody):**

No changes beyond Phase 1 (signerType support already in place).

**Backend (gateway):**

- **Publication CMS routes** (`publications.ts`): `POST/GET /publications/:id/articles` (submit + list), `PATCH/DELETE /publications/:id/articles/:articleId` (edit/delete), `POST .../publish` and `.../unpublish` (approve/reject).
- **Server-side publishing pipeline** (`publication-publisher.ts`): New service that orchestrates article submission — generates d-tags, builds NIP-23 events with author/publisher p-tags, signs with publication key via key-custody, publishes to relay, indexes in DB. Contributors without `can_publish` save as 'submitted'; editors approve and trigger full pipeline.
- **Signing routes** (`signing.ts`): `/sign` and `/sign-and-publish` accept optional `publicationId` — checks `can_publish` permission, signs with publication key.
- **Draft routes** (`drafts.ts`): drafts can be associated with a publication via `publicationId`.
- **Public reader routes** (`publications.ts`): `GET /:slug/public` (full profile with follower/member/article counts, isFollowing, isSubscribed), `GET /:slug/articles` (paginated), `GET /:slug/masthead`.
- **Publication subscriptions** (`subscriptions.ts`): `POST/DELETE /subscriptions/publication/:id`.
- **Publication follows** (`follows.ts`): `POST/DELETE /follows/publication/:id`. `GET /follows/pubkeys` includes followed publication pubkeys.
- **Publication RSS** (`rss.ts`): `GET /api/v1/pub/:slug/rss`.
- **Search** (`search.ts`): Publications searchable by name/tagline via pg_trgm.
- **Feed** (`feed.ts`): Following feed includes articles from followed publications.
- **Feed scorer** (`feed-scorer.ts`): Populates `publication_id` on feed_scores.
- **Article page** (`articles.ts`): `GET /articles/:dTag` now returns `publication` object (id, slug, name, subscriptionPricePence) when article belongs to a publication.
- **Writer profile** (`writers.ts`): Article queries filter `(publication_id IS NULL OR show_on_writer_profile = TRUE)`.

**Frontend (web):**

- **Editor** (`ArticleEditor.tsx`): "Publishing as" dropdown, "Also show on your personal profile" checkbox, "Submit for review" button for non-publishers.
- **Write page** (`write/page.tsx`): `?pub=<slug>` pre-selection, routes to `publishToPublication()` for publication articles.
- **Dashboard** (`dashboard/page.tsx`): Context switcher (Personal | Publication), publication-specific tabs (Articles, Members, Settings).
- **Publication dashboard tabs**: `PublicationArticlesTab.tsx` (CMS with publish/unpublish), `MembersTab.tsx` (invite, manage), `PublicationSettingsTab.tsx` (edit metadata).
- **Invite page** (`invite/[token]/page.tsx`): Shows invite details, accept/decline for logged-in users, signup redirect for anonymous.
- **Publication reader pages**: layout shell (`pub/[slug]/layout.tsx`), homepage with blog/magazine/minimal layouts (`page.tsx`), about, masthead, subscribe, archive, article-under-publication pages.
- **Publication components**: `PublicationNav.tsx`, `PublicationFooter.tsx`, `HomepageBlog.tsx`, `HomepageMagazine.tsx`, `HomepageMinimal.tsx`.
- **Article reader** (`ArticleReader.tsx`): "By Author in Publication" byline, publication subscription price used when applicable.
- **API client** (`api.ts`): Full publications namespace with reader-facing methods (getPublic, getPublicArticles, getMasthead, follow, unfollow, subscribe, cancelSubscription).

**New files:**

- `gateway/src/services/publication-publisher.ts`
- `web/src/components/dashboard/PublicationArticlesTab.tsx`

### From v5.17.0

**Migration required (038).** Services changed: **gateway**, **key-custody**, **web**. Deploy order: **migrate → rebuild gateway + key-custody + web**.

This release implements Publications Phase 1 — the schema and core services for multi-writer federated publications. Publications get their own custodial Nostr keypairs (stored in the `publications` table, managed by key-custody), an editorial membership model, and revenue pooling tables. The key-custody service now accepts a `signerType` parameter (`'account'` or `'publication'`) on all signing and encryption endpoints, allowing articles to be signed by a publication identity rather than an individual writer. The global CSS input reset is also removed, fixing editor field rendering.

**Database (migration 038):**

- **New types:** `publication_role` (`editor_in_chief`, `editor`, `contributor`), `contributor_type` (`permanent`, `one_off`).
- **New tables:** `publications`, `publication_members`, `publication_invites`, `publication_article_shares`, `publication_follows`, `publication_payouts`, `publication_payout_splits`.
- **Modified tables:**
  - `articles` — added `publication_id`, `publication_article_status`, `show_on_writer_profile` columns.
  - `article_drafts` — added `publication_id` column.
  - `subscriptions` — `writer_id` now nullable; added `publication_id`; unique constraint replaced with partial unique indexes per target type; added `subscriptions_target_check` constraint (exactly one of `writer_id`/`publication_id` must be set).
  - `subscription_nudge_log` — added `publication_id` column.
  - `feed_scores` — added `publication_id` column and index.
- **New platform config:** `publication_payout_threshold_pence` (default 2000 = £20.00).

**Backend (key-custody):**

- All signing and encryption endpoints (`/sign`, `/unwrap`, `/nip44-encrypt`, `/nip44-decrypt`) now accept `signerId` + `signerType` instead of `accountId`. When `signerType` is `'publication'`, the private key is looked up from the `publications` table. Backwards-compatible: `accountId` still accepted as a fallback.

**Backend (gateway):**

- `key-custody-client.ts` — all functions (`signEvent`, `unwrapKey`, `nip44Encrypt`, `nip44Decrypt`) updated to pass `signerId` and `signerType` parameters.
- New middleware: `publication-auth.ts` — publication-scoped authorisation for editorial endpoints.

**Frontend (web):**

- **Global input reset removed** (`globals.css`) — the blanket `input[type="text"]`, `textarea`, `select` rule that forced `bg-white` and `border: 1px solid #E5E5E5` on all form fields has been deleted. This fixes the article editor title and standfirst fields, which now render correctly as grey card panels without hairline outlines. Other form fields (auth page, etc.) are unaffected as they have their own inline styles.

**New files:**

- `migrations/038_publications.sql` — publications schema migration.
- `gateway/src/middleware/publication-auth.ts` — publication authorisation middleware.

**Modified files:**

- `schema.sql` — updated to incorporate migrations 001–038 (was 001–037).
- `key-custody/src/lib/crypto.ts` — `signerType` support on `signEvent`, `unwrapKey`, `nip44Encrypt`, `nip44Decrypt`, and `getDecryptedPrivkey`.
- `key-custody/src/routes/keypairs.ts` — schemas accept `signerId`/`signerType`, backwards-compatible with `accountId`.
- `gateway/src/lib/key-custody-client.ts` — passes `signerId`/`signerType` to key-custody.
- `web/src/app/globals.css` — global input/textarea/select reset removed.

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
cd /root/platform-pub
git pull origin master

# Apply migration
docker exec -i platform-pub-postgres-1 psql -U platformpub platformpub < migrations/038_publications.sql

# Rebuild changed services
docker compose build gateway key-custody web
docker compose up -d gateway key-custody web
```

Verify:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
# gateway, key-custody, and web should show (healthy) after ~30s

# Schema check:
docker exec platform-pub-postgres-1 psql -U platformpub platformpub \
  -c "SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public'"
# Should be 45+

# Publications table exists:
docker exec platform-pub-postgres-1 psql -U platformpub platformpub \
  -c "\d publications"

# Visual checks:
# - /write page: title and standfirst fields are grey card panels, no hairline outlines
# - /write page: no white-box-with-outline artefact on title/subtitle inputs
```

No new env vars.

### From v5.16.0

No migration. Services changed: **gateway**, **web**. Deploy order: **rebuild gateway + web**.

This release separates crowdfunding drives (public) from commissions (private, DM-only), fixes the `PledgeDrive` frontend types to match the backend API, and refreshes the article editor layout.

**Backend (gateway):**

- `GET /drives/by-user/:userId` — now filters to `origin = 'crowdfund'` only, so commissions never appear on public profiles or in the dashboard drives tab.

**Frontend (web):**

- **`PledgeDrive` type fixed** — interface now matches backend response: `origin` (not `type`), `fundingTargetPence` (not `targetAmountPence`), `currentTotalPence` (not `currentAmountPence`), `pinned` (not `pinnedOnProfile`), status enum aligned to `open | funded | published | fulfilled | expired | cancelled`.
- **`Pledge` type fixed** — `writer` is now a nested object `{ username, displayName }` matching backend; added `driveStatus` field.
- **Commissions removed from public surfaces:**
  - Commission button removed from writer profile pages (`WriterActivity.tsx`) — commissions now start from DMs only.
  - Commission button removed from note cards (`NoteCard.tsx`) and reply threads (`ReplyItem.tsx`) — `onCommission` prop removed.
  - `CommissionCard.tsx` deleted (was unused dead code).
- **Dashboard drives tab simplified:**
  - `DriveCreateForm` — crowdfund/commission toggle removed; form now creates crowdfund drives only.
  - `DriveCard` — commission accept/decline UI removed; always labelled "Pledge drive".
  - `DrivesTab` — "Incoming commissions" section removed; simplified to active vs completed.
- **CommissionForm cleaned up** — dead `openToBakers` checkbox removed; form retained for its one call site in `MessageThread.tsx` (DM-only commissions).
- **Article editor** — title and standfirst are now separate grey (`bg-grey-100`) cards with `p-8 sm:p-10` padding, matching the body editor field. No hairlines.

**Modified files:**

- `gateway/src/routes/drives.ts` — `by-user` endpoint filtered to crowdfund only
- `web/src/lib/api.ts` — `PledgeDrive` and `Pledge` interfaces fixed to match backend
- `web/src/components/dashboard/DriveCreateForm.tsx` — crowdfund-only, toggle removed
- `web/src/components/dashboard/DriveCard.tsx` — commission UI removed, field names fixed
- `web/src/components/dashboard/DrivesTab.tsx` — commission section removed, field names fixed
- `web/src/components/profile/ProfileDriveCard.tsx` — field names fixed
- `web/src/components/profile/WorkTab.tsx` — field name fix (`pinned`)
- `web/src/components/profile/WriterActivity.tsx` — commission button and modal removed
- `web/src/components/feed/NoteCard.tsx` — `onCommission` prop removed
- `web/src/components/replies/ReplyItem.tsx` — `onCommission` prop removed
- `web/src/components/ui/CommissionForm.tsx` — dead `openToBakers` state removed
- `web/src/components/account/PledgesSection.tsx` — uses `writer.username` (matches backend)
- `web/src/components/editor/ArticleEditor.tsx` — title and standfirst as separate grey cards

**Deleted files:**

- `web/src/components/feed/CommissionCard.tsx`

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
cd /root/platform-pub
git pull origin master

# No migration needed — only code changes
docker compose build gateway web
docker compose up -d gateway web
```

Verify:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
# gateway and web should show (healthy) after ~30s

# Visual checks:
# - Writer profile: no Commission button (Message button is still present)
# - Writer profile Work tab: pledge drives display correctly with progress bars
# - /dashboard?tab=drives: only crowdfund drives shown, no incoming commissions section
# - /dashboard?tab=drives: "New pledge drive" form has no crowdfund/commission toggle
# - /messages: Commission button still works in 1:1 DM threads
# - /write page: title and standfirst are separate grey cards, matching body field

### From v5.15.0

No migration. Services changed: **gateway**, **web**. Deploy order: **rebuild gateway + web**.

This release adds inline subscription management to profile Following/Followers tabs and cleans up the article editor chrome.

**Backend (gateway):**

- `GET /writers/:username/following` — now returns `subscriptionPricePence` and `hasPaywalledArticle` for each followed writer, enabling the frontend to show subscribe buttons inline.
- `GET /writers/:username/followers` — when the authenticated user is the profile owner, each follower includes `subscriptionStatus` (`'active'` or `'cancelled'`) if they are a subscriber.

**Frontend (web):**

- **FollowingTab** (own profile) — each followed writer now shows:
  - **Unfollow button** — removes the follow immediately.
  - **Subscribe button** — shown if the writer sells subscriptions and you're not subscribed; displays price (e.g. "Subscribe £5.00/mo").
  - **Subscribed button** — for active subscriptions; clicking opens a confirmation modal explaining that access continues until the end of the paid billing period. "Keep subscription" / "Cancel subscription" actions.
  - **Cancelled state** — button shows "Cancelled — resubscribe" in red with access-until tooltip; clicking resubscribes.
  - When viewing another user's profile, the tab displays as before (public "Subscribes to" section).
- **FollowersTab** (own profile) — followers with an active subscription show a "Subscriber" badge next to their name.
- **Article editor** — title and standfirst inputs wrapped in a single continuous grey (`bg-grey-100`) card with no hairlines between them. Toolbar changed from grey to white (`bg-white`). Gaps between fields eliminated. *(Superseded in v5.17.0 — title and standfirst are now separate cards.)*
- **API client** (`web/src/lib/api.ts`) — added missing `social.block(userId)` and `social.mute(userId)` POST wrappers to match existing backend endpoints.

**Modified files:**

- `gateway/src/routes/writers.ts` — enriched following/followers responses
- `web/src/components/profile/WriterActivity.tsx` — passes `isOwnProfile` to FollowersTab and FollowingTab
- `web/src/components/profile/FollowingTab.tsx` — rewritten: subscription management, unfollow, confirmation modal
- `web/src/components/profile/FollowersTab.tsx` — subscriber badge for own-profile view
- `web/src/components/editor/ArticleEditor.tsx` — grey card for title/standfirst, white toolbar, hairlines removed
- `web/src/lib/api.ts` — added `social.block()` and `social.mute()` methods

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
cd /root/platform-pub
git pull origin master

# No migration needed — only code changes
docker compose build gateway web
docker compose up -d gateway web
```

Verify:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
# gateway and web should show (healthy) after ~30s

# Visual checks:
# - Visit own profile → Following tab: each writer should have Unfollow button + Subscribe/Subscribed
# - Click "Subscribed" → modal asks to confirm cancellation with period-end date
# - Confirm → button changes to "Cancelled — resubscribe"
# - Visit own profile → Followers tab: subscribers show "Subscriber" badge
# - /write page: title + standfirst are one continuous grey card, toolbar is white
```

### From v5.14.0

No migration. Services changed: **web**. Deploy order: **rebuild web**.

This release resolves all remaining accessibility gaps identified in the codebase audit. Dropdowns now support keyboard navigation (Escape to close), avatar menu buttons have proper ARIA attributes, and the notification bell panel announces its expanded state to screen readers.

**Frontend (web):**

- **AvatarDropdown** (Nav.tsx): Escape key closes the dropdown. Dropdown panel has `role="menu"`. Both avatar trigger buttons (canvas mode and platform mode) have `aria-label="Account menu"` and `aria-expanded`.
- **NotificationBell** (NotificationBell.tsx): Escape key closes the notification panel. Trigger button has `aria-expanded`.

**Modified files:**

- `web/src/components/layout/Nav.tsx` — Escape handler, `role="menu"`, `aria-label`, `aria-expanded` on avatar dropdown and triggers
- `web/src/components/ui/NotificationBell.tsx` — Escape handler, `aria-expanded` on trigger button

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
cd /root/platform-pub
git pull origin master

# No migration needed — only frontend accessibility changes
docker compose build web
docker compose up -d web
```

Verify:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
# web should show (healthy) after ~30s

# Accessibility checks:
# - Click avatar in nav — dropdown opens. Press Escape — dropdown closes.
# - Click notification bell — panel opens. Press Escape — panel closes.
# - Inspect avatar button — should have aria-label="Account menu" and aria-expanded="true"/"false"
# - Inspect notification button — should have aria-expanded="true"/"false"
# - Inspect dropdown panel — should have role="menu"
```

No new env vars. No database changes.

## Nostr event types

| Kind | Type | Publisher | Purpose |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| 0 | Metadata | User (via key-custody) | Profile (name, bio, avatar) |
| 1 | Note | User (via key-custody) | Short-form post |
| 3 | Contacts | User (via key-custody) | Follow list |
| 5 | Deletion | User (via key-custody) | Soft-delete article or note. Published by the gateway on article delete and note delete — used by feed clients to filter deleted events from relay query results |
| 7003 | Subscription | Platform service key | Subscription status (provisional NIP-88) |
| 30023 | Long-form article | User or Publication (via key-custody) | NIP-23 article with optional `['payload', ciphertext, algorithm]` tag for paywalled content. Publication articles are signed with the publication's keypair (signerType='publication') and include author/publisher p-tags |
| 30024 | Draft | User (via key-custody) | NIP-23 draft |
| 9901 | Receipt | Platform service key | Gate-pass receipt (public relay: HMAC reader hash; private DB copy: actual reader pubkey) |

### Paywall content format

Paywalled articles embed encrypted content directly in the kind 30023 event:

```
tag: ['payload', <base64 ciphertext>, 'xchacha20poly1305']
```

Format: `base64(nonce[24] || ciphertext_with_tag)` — XChaCha20-Poly1305 via @noble/ciphers.

The content key is issued via `POST /api/v1/articles/:eventId/key` (after gate-pass), wrapped with NIP-44 (ChaCha20-Poly1305) to the reader's Nostr pubkey.

Legacy articles (pre-v3.0) used a separate kind 39701 vault event with AES-256-GCM. Both formats remain decryptable — the `algorithm` field in the key-service response drives the decryption path.

---

## Key custody

The `key-custody` service (port 3004) is the sole holder of all user and publication Nostr private keys. It holds `ACCOUNT_KEY_HEX` — the AES-256 key used to encrypt private keys at rest in `accounts.nostr_privkey_enc` and `publications.nostr_privkey_enc`. **No other service has access to this key.**

The gateway calls key-custody for these operations:
- `POST /keypairs/generate` — generate and store a new Nostr keypair for a new user
- `POST /keypairs/sign` — sign a Nostr event with a user's or publication's private key
- `POST /keypairs/unwrap-nip44` — NIP-44 decrypt (for reading encrypted DMs, key deliveries)
- `POST /keypairs/nip44-encrypt` — NIP-44 encrypt
- `POST /keypairs/nip44-decrypt` — NIP-44 decrypt

All signing and encryption endpoints accept `signerId` + `signerType` (`'account'` | `'publication'`). When `signerType` is `'publication'`, the private key is looked up from the `publications` table. Backwards-compatible: `accountId` still accepted.

All calls carry `x-internal-secret` (shared secret between gateway and key-custody). The key-custody service rejects any request missing this header.

---

## Author migration export

Writers can export a complete migration bundle via `GET /api/v1/account/export`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "exportedAt": "...",
  "account": { "nostrPubkey": "...", "username": "...", "displayName": "..." },
  "articles": [
    {
      "articleId": "...",
      "nostrEventId": "...",
      "dTag": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "isPaywalled": true,
      "algorithm": "xchacha20poly1305",
      "encryptedKey": "<NIP-44 wrapped to writer's own pubkey>",
      "readerPubkeys": ["<hex>", ...]
    }
  ],
  "summary": { "totalArticles": 5, "paywallArticles": 3, "contentKeysExported": 3, "uniqueReaders": 12 }
}
```

- `encryptedKey` — decrypt with the writer's own Nostr private key (NIP-44, sender = platform service key) to get the 32-byte content key, then use `algorithm` to decrypt the article body.
- `readerPubkeys` — readers who have paid for that article. A receiving host can honour these without re-charging.
- Nostr events (profile, follow list, articles) are on the relay and fetchable by the writer's pubkey — they are not duplicated in the export.

---

## Receipt portability

Readers export their paid-access receipts via `GET /api/v1/receipts/export`. Each receipt is a signed Nostr kind 9901 event (signed by the platform service key) containing:

```
['e', articleEventId]     — article read
['p', writerPubkey]       — writer
['reader', readerPubkey]  — reader (actual pubkey)
['amount', pence, 'GBP']  — amount charged
['gate', 'passed']
```

A receiving host verifies receipts by:
1. Fetching this host's signing pubkey: `GET /api/v1/platform-pubkey`
2. Calling `verifyEvent(receipt)` from nostr-tools
3. Checking `receipt.pubkey` matches the platform pubkey

---

## Subscription system

1. Writers set a monthly price (£1–£100, default £5)
2. Subscribers are charged immediately via Stripe; access is immediate
3. Active subscription unlocks all that writer's paywalled content at zero per-article cost
4. Each subscription creates a kind 7003 Nostr event (signed by platform service key) for federation
5. Unlocks are permanent — survive cancellation
6. Cancellation grants access until period end

### Access check priority

1. Own content → free
2. Publication member (if article belongs to a publication) → free
3. Permanent unlock (`article_unlocks`) → free, key reissued
4. Active subscription (writer or publication) → free, creates permanent unlock + subscription_read log
5. Payment flow → charges reading tab, creates permanent unlock

---

## Media uploads

Images uploaded via `POST /api/v1/media/upload` are resized (max 1200px), converted to WebP (quality 80), and written to the `media_data` volume at `/app/media/<sha256>.webp`. Nginx serves them at `/media/<sha256>.webp` with 1-year cache headers.

## Known limitations (v4.8.0)

- RSS feed ingestion not yet built
- NIP-07 browser extension support not yet built
- Cash-out-at-will (writer-initiated payout) not yet implemented
- Stripe payment collection not yet live — free allowance goes negative as a testing workaround
- Email sending requires configuring `EMAIL_PROVIDER` — defaults to console logging
- Docker healthchecks on some Alpine containers report "unhealthy" due to missing `wget`/`curl` in the image, despite services running correctly

## Change log

### v5.19.0 — 6 April 2026

**Publications Phases 2 & 3: CMS pipeline, reader surface, feed/search integration**

No new migration (uses 038 from v5.18.0). Services changed: gateway, key-custody, web.

- **Server-side publishing pipeline:** Articles submitted to publications are signed with the publication's Nostr keypair (via key-custody), published to the relay, and indexed — all orchestrated server-side. Contributors without `can_publish` save as 'submitted'; editors approve to trigger the full pipeline.
- **Publication CMS routes:** Submit, list, edit, delete, publish, unpublish articles within a publication. Signing routes accept `publicationId` for publication-key signing.
- **Publication reader pages:** Homepage (blog/magazine/minimal layouts), about, masthead, subscribe, archive, and article-under-publication pages at `/pub/<slug>/...`.
- **Publication subscriptions and follows:** Subscribe/unsubscribe and follow/unfollow routes for publications. Following feed includes content from followed publications.
- **Publication RSS:** Per-publication RSS feed at `/api/v1/pub/<slug>/rss`.
- **Search integration:** Publications searchable by name and tagline.
- **Feed scoring:** `feed_scores.publication_id` populated by the scoring worker.
- **Article page awareness:** Articles show "By Author in Publication" byline with link. Publication subscription price used for CTA.
- **Writer profile filtering:** Publication-only articles hidden unless `show_on_writer_profile` is true.
- **Editor integration:** "Publishing as" dropdown, "Submit for review" for non-publishers, "Also show on your personal profile" checkbox.
- **Dashboard context switcher:** Personal vs publication context with publication-specific tabs (Articles, Members, Settings).
- **Invite acceptance page:** `/invite/<token>` with accept/decline for logged-in, signup redirect for anonymous.

### v5.18.0 — 6 April 2026

**Publications Phase 1: schema, key-custody publication signing, CSS fix**

New migration (038). Services changed: gateway, key-custody, web.

- **Publications schema (migration 038):** 7 new tables (`publications`, `publication_members`, `publication_invites`, `publication_article_shares`, `publication_follows`, `publication_payouts`, `publication_payout_splits`), 2 new enums (`publication_role`, `contributor_type`). Modified `articles`, `article_drafts`, `subscriptions`, `subscription_nudge_log`, `feed_scores` with publication columns. New platform config `publication_payout_threshold_pence`.
- **Key-custody publication signing:** All signing/encryption endpoints (`/sign`, `/unwrap`, `/nip44-encrypt`, `/nip44-decrypt`) accept `signerId` + `signerType` (`'account'` | `'publication'`). Publication keys looked up from `publications` table. Backwards-compatible with `accountId`.
- **Gateway:** `key-custody-client.ts` updated for `signerId`/`signerType`. New `publication-auth.ts` middleware. New `publications.ts` route file.
- **CSS fix:** Removed global input/textarea/select reset (`bg-white` + `border: 1px solid`) from `globals.css` that was overriding editor field styling.

---

### v5.17.0 — 6 April 2026

**Separate crowdfunding drives from commissions, editor card refresh**

No migration. Services changed: gateway, web.

- **Crowdfunding drives are public, commissions are private (DM-only).** The `by-user` endpoint now filters to `origin = 'crowdfund'`, so commissions never appear on profiles or in the dashboard drives tab. Commission creation remains available exclusively in DM message threads via `CommissionForm`.
- **`PledgeDrive` frontend type fixed** to match backend API response: `origin` (was `type`), `fundingTargetPence` (was `targetAmountPence`), `currentTotalPence` (was `currentAmountPence`), `pinned` (was `pinnedOnProfile`), status enum aligned to backend (`open | funded | published | fulfilled | expired | cancelled`).
- **`Pledge` frontend type fixed** to match backend: `writer` is now nested `{ username, displayName }` (was flat `writerUsername`), added `driveStatus`.
- **Commission UI removed from public surfaces:** Commission button removed from writer profiles (`WriterActivity`), note cards (`NoteCard`), and reply threads (`ReplyItem`). `CommissionCard.tsx` deleted (was unused). Dashboard `DriveCreateForm` no longer offers a commission option. Dashboard `DriveCard` no longer shows accept/decline commission UI. Dashboard `DrivesTab` no longer shows an "Incoming commissions" section.
- **`CommissionForm` cleaned up:** dead `openToBakers` checkbox removed (was never sent to API). Form retained for DM use in `MessageThread.tsx`.
- **Article editor:** title and standfirst are now separate `bg-grey-100` cards with `p-8 sm:p-10` padding, matching the body editor field. No hairlines between fields.

---

### v5.13.0 — 6 April 2026

**Subscription offers system (discount codes + gifted subscriptions)**

New migration (037). Services changed: gateway, web.

- **Subscription offers table:** `subscription_offers` with two modes — `code` (shareable link, anyone redeems) and `grant` (assigned to a specific reader). Writer-configurable: label, discount % (0–100), duration in months (or permanent), max redemptions, expiry date.
- **Offer-aware subscribe:** `POST /subscriptions/:writerId` accepts optional `offerCode`. Validates offer (not revoked, not expired, under redemption cap, grant recipient matches), applies discount to price, sets `offer_id` and `offer_periods_remaining` on the subscription row, increments redemption count.
- **Offer period expiry in renewal:** `expireAndRenewSubscriptions()` decrements `offer_periods_remaining` on each renewal. When it reaches 0, the subscription reverts to the writer's current standard price and the offer columns are cleared.
- **Dashboard Offers tab:** New tab between "Pledge drives" and "Settings". "New offer code" and "Gift subscription" inline forms. Offers table with mode badge, discount, duration, redemption count, copy-link, and revoke actions. Collapsible revoked section.
- **Redeem page (`/subscribe/:code`):** Public landing page for offer codes. Shows writer name, offer label, standard vs discounted price, duration info. Auth gate with redirect-back. Subscribe button with success redirect to writer profile.
- **Editor bug fixes:** Fixed stale closure in auto-save (title/dek/price now use refs), fixed price auto-suggestion overwriting manual edits (tracks `userSetPrice`), applied grey-card styling refresh to editor surfaces.

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U platformpub platformpub \
  < migrations/037_subscription_offers.sql
docker compose build gateway web
docker compose up -d gateway web
```

### v5.12.0 — 6 April 2026

**Gift link polish, DM commissions, DM pricing config, JWT hardening**

New migration (036). Services changed: gateway, web, shared.

- **Gift link dashboard management:** Writer dashboard Articles tab shows "Gifts" toggle on paywalled articles, expanding an inline panel to create, list (with redemption counts), copy, and revoke gift links (`GiftLinksPanel.tsx`).
- **Gift link in ShareButton:** ShareButton dropdown now includes a "Gift link" option (separated by a divider) on the author's own paywalled articles. The standalone "Gift link" button in the article byline has been removed.
- **Commission from DM threads:** MessageThread header shows a "Commission" button (1:1 conversations only). Opens CommissionForm in a modal, pre-wired with the conversation partner and conversation ID. Migration 036 adds `parent_conversation_id` to `pledge_drives`. *(As of v5.17.0, this is the only commission entry point — commission buttons were removed from profiles, notes, and replies.)*
- **DM pricing configuration:** New endpoints `GET/PUT /settings/dm-pricing` and `PUT/DELETE /settings/dm-pricing/override/:userId`. Dashboard Settings tab replaces "Coming soon" placeholder with a default rate form and collapsible per-user overrides section (with username search + add/remove).
- **JWT session lifetime reduced:** `TOKEN_LIFETIME_SECONDS` from 7 days → 2 hours, `REFRESH_AFTER_SECONDS` from 3.5 days → 1 hour. Active users refreshed seamlessly; idle sessions expire in 2 hours.

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U platformpub platformpub \
  < migrations/036_commission_conversation.sql
docker compose build gateway web
docker compose up -d gateway web
```

### v5.11.0 — 6 April 2026

**Notification centre redesigned as permanent activity log**

No migration. Services changed: gateway, web.

- `GET /notifications` returns read + unread notifications with cursor-based pagination (`?cursor=<ISO>&limit=30`). Response: `{ notifications, unreadCount, nextCursor }`.
- Notifications page is now a permanent log. Unread items are bold with crimson dot; read items are muted but remain visible. "Load older notifications" for pagination.
- NotificationBell dropdown shows most recent 10 (read + unread), marks read on click instead of removing. "View all notifications" link to full log.
- Removed phantom types `dm_payment_required` and `new_user` from frontend `NotificationType` union (backend never creates these).

**Upgrade steps:**
```bash
docker compose build gateway web
docker compose up -d gateway web
```


> **Older versions:** Changelog entries for v5.10.2 and earlier are available in this file's git history.
