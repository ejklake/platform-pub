          Writers post Articles (which can be paywalled) and Notes (which can&rsquo;t). Readers follow for free, or subscribe monthly to unlock everything a writer puts behind a paywall. Prefer to browse? Pay as you go: unlock individual pieces for very small fees.

          Charges accumulate on a Tab (think bar tab) and settle through Stripe. Writers get paid the same way, in batches, once the balance is big enough that transaction fees won&rsquo;t eat it.

          Platform runs on Nostr, an open-source, peer-to-peer messaging protocol popular with privacy advocates, libertarians and Bitcoin enthusiasts. You don&rsquo;t need to be any of those things to like what it makes possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, Platform hosts your content and manages your payments, taking an 8% cut to cover running costs. But your account, your content, your follows, and your reading permissions are all genuinely portable. Your identity is a cryptographic key pair held in a secure locker that Platform can&rsquo;t read. You can move it to another custodian, a browser extension, or a piece of paper whenever you like. If you don&rsquo;t like what Platform is doing, leave for another host (or run your own) taking your followers, your payment receipts, and your self-respect with you.
        </p>

          Sign up, log in with Google if you like, and use what looks and feels like a straightforward web app. Your account comes with &pound;5 of credit to get started. When it runs out, connect a payment method and carry on &mdash; safe in the knowledge that your Platform account is genuinely yours.
